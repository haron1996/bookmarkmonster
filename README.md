[`Bookmarkmonster`](https://bookmarkmonster.xyz/dashboard?tag=all-tags)
 
 About 4 months ago, I released a cloud bookmark manager with nested folders... using [`Go for backend`](https://github.com/kwandapchumba/cloud-bookmark-manager) and [`Sveltekit for frontend`](https://github.com/kwandapchumba/svelte)

[`Bookmarkmonster`](https://bookmarkmonster.xyz/dashboard?tag=all-tags) is a tag based version of it.

It lets you save and tag websites you can visit them later.
